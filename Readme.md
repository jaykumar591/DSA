## LinkedList
 -  A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in
 memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a

 -  collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.
 -  In simple words, a linked list is a list of elements (called nodes) in which
 each node contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
 -  This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence.
 -  Linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science and are used in many applications, such
 as databases, file systems, and web browsers.
 -  There are several types of linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and
 circular linked lists.
 -  A singly linked list is the most basic type of linked list, where each node only points
 to the next node in the sequence.
 -  A doubly linked list is a type of linked list where each node points to both the next
 and previous nodes in the sequence.
 -  A circular linked list is a type of linked list where the last node points back to the
 first node, forming a circle.

## Bim Manupulation
-  Bim manipulation is a technique used in computer graphics to manipulate 3D models by
-  modifying the vertices, edges, and faces of the model.
-  It is used to perform various operations such as translation, rotation, scaling, and
deformation of the model.
-  Bim manipulation is used in various fields such as architecture, engineering, and    
game development.
-  It is a powerful tool for creating complex 3D models and animations.
-  Bim manipulation can be performed using various software such as Blender, Maya, and 3
-  It is a key technique in computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aid
aided engineering (CAE).
